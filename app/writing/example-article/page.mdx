# Example Article

This is an example article to demonstrate the MDX-based writing system. You can write your content in Markdown format with full support for React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components directly in your articles.

## Features

Here are some features you can use in your articles:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms
- [Links to external resources](https://nextjs.org)

### Code Blocks

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

### Lists

Ordered lists work too:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Images

You can add images by placing them in the same directory as your article:

![Example image description](/example-image.png)
